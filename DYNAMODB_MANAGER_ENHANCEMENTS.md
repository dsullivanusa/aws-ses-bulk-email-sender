# - dynamodb:Scan
# - dynamodb:BatchWriteItem
# - dynamodb:DeleteItem
```

**Issue: "Some records not deleted"**

**Cause:** Errors during batch delete (shown in error count)

**Solution:**
- Check CloudWatch logs
- Retry delete operation
- Use Bulk Delete with specific filter instead

### Edit Issues:

**Issue: "Can't save edited record"**

**Cause:** Invalid JSON or missing primary key

**Solution:**
1. Click "✅ Validate JSON" first
