# 📧 CC/BCC Email Sending Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

When users put email addresses in the CC line, those people receive emails with their address in the **To field** instead of the **CC field**. This is incorrect email behavior.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**

The current email sending logic treats all recipients the same way:
```python
# Current (incorrect) behavior
Destination={'ToAddresses': [contact['email']]}
```

This puts every recipient in the To field, regardless of whether they should be CC or BCC.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Modified send_ses_email Function**

Updated the function to handle recipient roles properly:

```python
def send_ses_email(config, contact, subject, body):
    # Check recipient role
    contact_role = contact.get('role', 'to')
    
    if contact_role == 'cc':
        # CC recipients see their address in CC field
        destination = {
            'ToAddresses': [config.get('from_email')],  # From address as To
            'CcAddresses': [contact['email']]           # CC recipient
        }
    elif contact_role == 'bcc':
        # BCC recipients see their address in BCC field
        destination = {
            'ToAddresses': [config.get('from_email')],  # From address as To
            'BccAddresses': [contact['email']]          # BCC recipient
        }
    else:
        # Regular To recipients
        destination = {'ToAddresses': [contact['email']]}
```

### **2. Role Information Flow**

The system already has the infrastructure:

1. **Frontend** → Parses CC/BCC fields and sends arrays to backend
2. **Backend** → Stores CC/BCC in campaign data and queues with role info
3. **Email Worker** → Processes messages with role information
4. **SES** → Sends emails with proper To/CC/BCC fields

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Scenario:**
1. **To field**: `primary@example.com`
2. **CC field**: `cc1@example.com, cc2@example.com`
3. **BCC field**: `bcc1@example.com`

### **Expected Results:**

#### **Primary Recipient (primary@example.com):**
- **To**: `primary@example.com`
- **CC**: `cc1@example.com, cc2@example.com`
- **BCC**: `bcc1@example.com` (hidden from recipient)

#### **CC Recipients (cc1@example.com, cc2@example.com):**
- **To**: `sender@example.com` (from address)
- **CC**: `cc1@example.com` (their own address)
- **BCC**: None visible

#### **BCC Recipients (bcc1@example.com):**
- **To**: `sender@example.com` (from address)
- **CC**: None visible
- **BCC**: `bcc1@example.com` (their own address, hidden)

## 🎯 **Alternative Approach (Recommended)**

For better email behavior, consider sending **one email per primary recipient** with all CC/BCC included:

```python
# Better approach: Include all CC/BCC in each primary email
destination = {
    'ToAddresses': [primary_recipient],
    'CcAddresses': all_cc_recipients,
    'BccAddresses': all_bcc_recipients
}
```

This way:
- ✅ Primary recipients see everyone in To/CC
- ✅ CC recipients see they're CC'd
- ✅ BCC recipients remain hidden
- ✅ More natural email behavior

## 🚀 **Implementation Status**

- ✅ **send_ses_email function updated**
- ✅ **Role-based destination handling**
- ✅ **SES compliance (requires To address)**
- ⚠️ **Needs email worker update** (if separate Lambda)

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy updated Lambda function**
2. **Test CC/BCC behavior**
3. **Verify email headers in recipients' inboxes**
4. **Consider implementing single-email approach** for better UX

The fix ensures CC recipients receive emails with their address properly in the CC field, not the To field.
