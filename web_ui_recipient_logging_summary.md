# Web UI Recipient Logging - Summary

## ✅ **LOGGING ADDED TO WEB UI**

I've added comprehensive logging of To, CC, and BCC lines in the web UI (`bulk_email_api_lambda.py`). Here's what was added:

## 📍 **Logging Locations**

### 1. **Console Logging** (Browser Developer Tools)
**Location**: `sendCampaign()` function - after recipient extraction
**What it shows**: Detailed recipient information in browser console

```javascript
console.log('📧 EMAIL RECIPIENTS - WEB UI LOGGING:');
console.log('==================================================');
console.log('📬 To Recipients:', toList.length > 0 ? toList : 'None');
console.log('📋 CC Recipients:', ccList.length > 0 ? ccList : 'None');
console.log('🔒 BCC Recipients:', bccList.length > 0 ? bccList : 'None');
console.log('📊 Total Recipients: To=' + toList.length + ', CC=' + ccList.length + ', BCC=' + bccList.length);
```

### 2. **Visual Debug Display** (Temporary UI Display)
**Location**: Campaign form - shows before sending
**What it shows**: Recipients in a blue info box that appears temporarily

```
📧 Campaign Recipients Debug
📬 To Recipients (2): user1@example.com, user2@example.com
📋 CC Recipients (1): cc@example.com
🔒 BCC Recipients (1): bcc@example.com
This debug info will be replaced when the campaign is sent...
```

### 3. **Toast Notification** (Pop-up Notification)
**Location**: Appears when campaign is being sent
**What it shows**: Quick summary of recipient counts

```
📧 Recipients: To: 2, CC: 1, BCC: 1
```

### 4. **Success Display** (Campaign Results)
**Location**: After campaign is successfully queued
**What it shows**: Detailed recipient breakdown in the success message

```
📧 Email Recipients
📬 To: user1@example.com, user2@example.com
📋 CC: cc@example.com
🔒 BCC: bcc@example.com
```

### 5. **Preview Logging** (Email Preview)
**Location**: When generating email previews
**What it shows**: Recipients for preview context

```javascript
console.log('📧 EMAIL RECIPIENTS - PREVIEW LOGGING:');
console.log('📬 To Recipients (Preview):', toList);
console.log('📋 CC Recipients (Preview):', ccList);
console.log('🔒 BCC Recipients (Preview):', bccList);
```

## 🔍 **How to View the Logging**

### **Browser Console Logging**:
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Send a campaign** with CC/BCC recipients
4. **Look for messages** starting with `📧 EMAIL RECIPIENTS`

### **Visual UI Logging**:
1. **Fill out campaign form** with CC/BCC recipients
2. **Click Send Campaign**
3. **Watch for**:
   - Blue debug box (temporary)
   - Toast notification (top-right)
   - Success display (after sending)

## 📊 **Example Output**

### **Console Output**:
```
📧 EMAIL RECIPIENTS - WEB UI LOGGING:
==================================================
📬 To Recipients: ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
📋 CC Recipients: ["cc@example.com"]
🔒 BCC Recipients: ["bcc@example.com"]
📊 Total Recipients: To=2, CC=1, BCC=1
==================================================
```

### **Visual Output**:
- **Debug Box**: Shows recipients before sending
- **Toast**: "📧 Recipients: To: 2, CC: 1, BCC: 1"
- **Success Display**: Formatted recipient breakdown

## 🎯 **Benefits**

1. **Immediate Visibility**: See recipients before sending
2. **Debugging**: Identify CC duplication issues
3. **Verification**: Confirm recipients are correct
4. **Troubleshooting**: Track recipient processing
5. **User Feedback**: Clear indication of who will receive emails

## 🚀 **Deployment**

1. **Upload** the updated `bulk_email_api_lambda.py` to AWS Lambda
2. **Deploy** the function
3. **Test** by creating a campaign with CC/BCC recipients
4. **Check** browser console and UI for the new logging

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

If you don't see the logging:
1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Ensure** you're using CC/BCC fields in the campaign form
3. **Verify** the Lambda function was updated and deployed
4. **Clear browser cache** if needed

The logging will help you verify that the CC duplication fix is working correctly by showing exactly who is being processed as To, CC, and BCC recipients!
