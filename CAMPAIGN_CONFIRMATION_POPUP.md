# Campaign Confirmation Popup

## Feature
Added a confirmation popup that appears when the user clicks "Send Campaign" button, showing the total number of recipients and requiring explicit confirmation before sending emails.

## Implementation

### Location
**File:** `bulk_email_api_lambda.py`  
**Lines:** 3813-3845  
**Function:** `sendCampaign(event)`

### Code Added

```javascript
// CONFIRMATION POPUP - Show total recipient count and ask for confirmation
const confirmationMessage = `
📧 Campaign Confirmation

You are about to send this campaign to:

📊 Total Recipients: ${allTargetEmails.length}

Breakdown:
• Contacts from database: ${targetEmails.length}
• CC recipients: ${ccList.length}
• BCC recipients: ${bccList.length}

Filter: ${filterDescription}

⚠️ Are you sure you want to send this campaign?

Click OK to proceed or Cancel to abort.
`.trim();

// Show confirmation dialog and wait for user response
const userConfirmed = confirm(confirmationMessage);

if (!userConfirmed) {
    // User clicked Cancel
    button.textContent = originalText;
    button.classList.remove('loading');
    button.disabled = false;
    console.log('Campaign send cancelled by user');
    return; // Exit without sending
}

console.log('User confirmed campaign send');
```

## User Experience

### Workflow

1. User fills out campaign form (subject, body, etc.)
2. User selects targets (clicks "All" or applies filters)
3. User enters CC/BCC email addresses (optional)
4. User clicks **"Send Campaign"** button
5. **Confirmation popup appears** ⬅️ NEW
6. User sees:
   - Total number of recipients
   - Breakdown by source (contacts, CC, BCC)
   - Filter description
7. User clicks:
   - **OK** → Campaign sends
   - **Cancel** → Campaign cancelled, form remains as-is

## Information Displayed

### 1. **Total Recipients**
The actual count of unique email addresses that will receive the campaign, including:
- Contacts from database (after filtering)
- CC email addresses
- BCC email addresses
- Duplicates are removed (shown as unique count)

### 2. **Breakdown**
Detailed counts showing where recipients came from:
- **Contacts from database:** Number from selected/filtered contacts
- **CC recipients:** Number of CC email addresses entered
- **BCC recipients:** Number of BCC email addresses entered

### 3. **Filter Description**
Shows which filter was applied:
- "All Contacts" - if "All" button was clicked
- "state: California, Texas" - if specific filter applied
- "entity_type: State Government" - shows filter criteria

### 4. **Confirmation Question**
Clear call to action asking user to confirm or cancel

## Data Source

### Contacts Count
- **Source:** DynamoDB `EmailContacts` table
- **When:** Retrieved when user applies filter or clicks "All"
- **Stored in:** `campaignFilteredContacts` array
- **Processing:** Filtered for valid email addresses only

### CC Count
- **Source:** `campaignCc` input field
- **Processing:** Comma-separated string parsed into array
- **Validation:** Only valid email format included

### BCC Count
- **Source:** `campaignBcc` input field
- **Processing:** Comma-separated string parsed into array
- **Validation:** Only valid email format included

### Total Count
- **Calculation:** Union of all three sources
- **Deduplication:** Using JavaScript Set to remove duplicates
- **Formula:** `unique(contacts + CC + BCC)`

## User Actions

### If User Clicks "OK"
1. Popup closes
2. Button text changes to "Sending Campaign..."
3. Campaign data is sent to backend
4. Emails are queued for sending
5. Success message appears

### If User Clicks "Cancel"
1. Popup closes
2. Button returns to "🚀 Send Campaign"
3. Button re-enabled
4. Form remains filled (no data lost)
5. Console logs: "Campaign send cancelled by user"
6. No emails are sent

## Benefits

✅ **Prevent Accidental Sends** - Double confirmation before sending  
✅ **Visibility** - User sees exact recipient count before sending  
✅ **Transparency** - Shows breakdown of where recipients came from  
✅ **Control** - Easy to cancel if count is wrong  
✅ **Audit Trail** - Console logs confirmation/cancellation  
✅ **Peace of Mind** - User can verify before committing  

## Safety Features

### 1. **Count Verification**
User can verify the recipient count matches expectations before sending

### 2. **Filter Visibility**
Shows which filter was applied to avoid confusion about who will receive emails

### 3. **Easy Cancellation**
One click to cancel without losing form data

### 4. **No Accidental Double-Click**
Button is disabled during processing to prevent duplicate sends

### 5. **Console Logging**
All actions logged for debugging and audit purposes

## Examples

### Example 1: Send to All Contacts
```
User Action: Click "All" → "Apply Filter" → "Send Campaign"

Popup Shows:
📊 Total Recipients: 1,247
• Contacts from database: 1,247
• CC recipients: 0
• BCC recipients: 0
Filter: All Contacts
```

### Example 2: Filtered Contacts with CC
```
User Action: Select "State: CA, TX" → "Apply Filter" → Add CC → "Send Campaign"

Popup Shows:
📊 Total Recipients: 352
• Contacts from database: 350
• CC recipients: 2
• BCC recipients: 0
Filter: state: CA, TX
```

### Example 3: Small Group with CC and BCC
```
User Action: Select "K-12: Yes" → "Apply Filter" → Add CC and BCC → "Send Campaign"

Popup Shows:
📊 Total Recipients: 127
• Contacts from database: 120
• CC recipients: 5
• BCC recipients: 2
Filter: k12: Yes
```

### Example 4: CC/BCC Only (No Contacts)
```
User Action: Add CC and BCC without selecting contacts → "Send Campaign"

Popup Shows:
📊 Total Recipients: 3
• Contacts from database: 0
• CC recipients: 2
• BCC recipients: 1
Filter: None (Direct recipients only)
```

## Technical Details

### Timing
- Popup appears **before** API call is made
- All validation is complete before popup
- Target count is final count (no changes after confirmation)

### Button State Management
- Button disabled during popup display
- Button text: "Sending Campaign..." if confirmed
- Button restored if cancelled

### Error Handling
- If user cancels: Clean exit, no error thrown
- If validation fails before popup: Error shown instead of popup
- If API fails after confirmation: Error shown with button restored

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Send to all contacts - verify count matches total in database
- [ ] Send with filter - verify count matches filtered results
- [ ] Send with CC only - verify CC count shown
- [ ] Send with BCC only - verify BCC count shown
- [ ] Send with contacts + CC + BCC - verify all counts sum correctly
- [ ] Click Cancel - verify no emails sent and form intact
- [ ] Click OK - verify campaign sends successfully
- [ ] Duplicate email in CC and contacts - verify deduplicated count
- [ ] Empty CC/BCC fields - verify shows 0 for those fields
- [ ] Check console logs - verify confirmation/cancellation logged

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved  
✅ **Optional fields** - CC/BCC still optional  
✅ **Filter logic** - No changes to filter behavior  
✅ **API calls** - Same payload structure  
✅ **Campaign sending** - Same backend processing  

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Show preview of first 5 recipient emails
- Display campaign name and subject in confirmation
- Add "Don't show this again" checkbox (with localStorage)
- Show estimated send time based on rate limits
- Add "Send Test" button to send to one recipient first
