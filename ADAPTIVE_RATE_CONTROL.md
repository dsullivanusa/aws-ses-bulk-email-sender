# üöÄ Adaptive Rate Control for Email Campaigns

## Overview

The email worker Lambda function now includes adaptive rate control that automatically adjusts email sending rates based on:

1. **Attachment Sizes** - Larger attachments trigger slower sending rates
2. **Throttle Detection** - Automatically detects and responds to rate limit exceptions
3. **Dynamic Recovery** - Gradually recovers from throttling conditions

## üéØ Key Features

### Attachment-Based Rate Control
- **Small attachments** (‚â§1MB): 1.5x slower rate
- **Medium attachments** (1-5MB): 2.0x slower rate  
- **Large attachments** (5-10MB): 3.0x slower rate
- **Very large attachments** (>10MB): Maximum delay applied

### Throttle Detection & Recovery
- **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes AWS SES and SMTP throttle exceptions
- **Exponential Backoff**: Doubles delay when throttling is detected
- **Gradual Recovery**: Reduces delay by 10% every minute after throttling stops
- **Maximum Backoffs**: Limits consecutive backoffs to prevent excessive delays

### Configurable Parameters
All settings can be configured via environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `BASE_DELAY_SECONDS` | 0.1 | Base delay between emails (seconds) |
| `MAX_DELAY_SECONDS` | 5.0 | Maximum delay allowed (seconds) |
| `MIN_DELAY_SECONDS` | 0.01 | Minimum delay allowed (seconds) |

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Pre-Send Analysis
```python
# Before sending each email:
attachments = campaign.get('attachments', [])
delay = rate_control.get_delay_for_email(attachments)
time.sleep(delay)
```

### 2. Attachment Size Detection
```python
# Calculates total attachment size from S3 metadata
total_size = sum(attachment_sizes)
if total_size > 5MB:
    delay_factor = 3.0  # 3x slower
```

### 3. Throttle Exception Handling
```python
# Detects throttle exceptions and adjusts rate
if rate_control.detect_throttle_exception(exception):
    rate_control.handle_throttle_detected()  # Double the delay
```

### 4. Gradual Recovery
```python
# Every minute, gradually reduce delay if no new throttles
if time_since_last_throttle > 60 seconds:
    current_delay *= 0.9  # Reduce by 10%
```

## üìà Monitoring & Logging

The system provides detailed logging for monitoring:

```
[Message 1] Applying adaptive rate control delay: 0.300s
[Message 1] Attachment size: 3MB (medium), delay factor: 2.0x, calculated delay: 0.300s
[Message 2] Throttle detected! Increasing delay to 0.600s (backoff #1)
[Message 3] Recovering from throttle - reducing delay to 0.540s
```

### Rate Control Statistics
Each Lambda invocation returns statistics:
```json
{
  "rate_control_stats": {
    "total_delay_applied": 2.45,
    "throttles_detected": 1,
    "attachment_delays_applied": 5
  }
}
```

## üîß Configuration Examples

### Conservative Settings (Slower, More Reliable)
```bash
BASE_DELAY_SECONDS=0.5
MAX_DELAY_SECONDS=10.0
MIN_DELAY_SECONDS=0.1
```

### Aggressive Settings (Faster, Higher Risk)
```bash
BASE_DELAY_SECONDS=0.05
MAX_DELAY_SECONDS=2.0
MIN_DELAY_SECONDS=0.01
```

### High-Volume Campaign Settings
```bash
BASE_DELAY_SECONDS=0.2
MAX_DELAY_SECONDS=8.0
MIN_DELAY_SECONDS=0.05
```

## üö® Throttle Exception Detection

The system detects various types of throttle exceptions:

### AWS SES Exceptions
- `Throttling` error codes
- `ServiceUnavailable` errors
- `SlowDown` responses
- Messages containing "rate exceeded"

### SMTP Exceptions
- "too many requests"
- "quota exceeded" 
- "service unavailable"
- "slow down"

## üìã Deployment

### 1. Update Lambda Function
```bash
python deploy_email_worker.py
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables (Optional)
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name email-worker-function \
  --environment Variables='{
    "BASE_DELAY_SECONDS":"0.2",
    "MAX_DELAY_SECONDS":"8.0"
  }'
```

### 3. Monitor CloudWatch Logs
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/email-worker-function --follow
```

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Automatic Optimization**: No manual rate tuning required
2. **Attachment Awareness**: Automatically slows down for large files
3. **Throttle Resilience**: Handles rate limits gracefully
4. **Gradual Recovery**: Returns to optimal speed when conditions improve
5. **Detailed Monitoring**: Full visibility into rate control decisions
6. **Configurable**: Easy to adjust for different use cases

## üîç Troubleshooting

### High Delay Times
- Check attachment sizes in logs
- Review throttle detection frequency
- Consider increasing `BASE_DELAY_SECONDS` if throttling frequently

### Frequent Throttling
- Increase `MAX_DELAY_SECONDS` to allow more aggressive backoff
- Review AWS SES sending quotas
- Consider splitting large campaigns

### Slow Recovery
- Check `throttle_recovery_time` setting (default 60 seconds)
- Review consecutive throttle counts in logs
- Ensure no continuous throttling conditions

## üìä Performance Impact

### Without Adaptive Rate Control
- Fixed rate regardless of conditions
- Risk of hitting throttle limits
- Manual intervention required for large attachments

### With Adaptive Rate Control
- Dynamic rate adjustment based on conditions
- Automatic throttle handling
- Optimized performance for different attachment sizes
- Detailed monitoring and statistics

The system typically adds 0.1-5 seconds of delay per email, but prevents failed sends and reduces overall campaign completion time by avoiding throttles.
