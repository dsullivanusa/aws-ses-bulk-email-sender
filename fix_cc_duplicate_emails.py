Fix CC Duplicate Emails Issue

The problem: CC recipients are receiving duplicate emails because they're being queued twice:
1. Once as regular contacts (if they exist in the contacts database)
2. Once as CC recipients (with role='cc')

This script fixes the issue by ensuring proper exclusion of CC/BCC recipients from regular contact processing.
