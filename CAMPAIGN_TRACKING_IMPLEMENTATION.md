# 📊 Campaign Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete campaign tracking system has been added to the project, capturing detailed information about every email campaign including who launched it, when emails were sent, and which recipients received the campaign.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Campaign Data Model

**New Fields Added to EmailCampaigns Table:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `launched_by` | String | User who initiated campaign (includes IP address) |
| `sent_at` | ISO DateTime | Timestamp when first email was actually sent |
| `target_contacts` | List | Complete array of recipient email addresses |
| `created_at` | ISO DateTime | When campaign was created (already existed) |
| `campaign_id` | String | Unique identifier (already existed) |
| `campaign_name` | String | User-defined name (already existed) |
| `status` | String | queued/sending/completed/failed (enhanced) |
| `sent_count` | Number | Successfully sent emails (already existed) |
| `failed_count` | Number | Failed email attempts (already existed) |
| `total_contacts` | Number | Total target recipients (already existed) |
| `filter_description` | String | Human-readable filter (already existed) |

### 2. Code Changes

#### `bulk_email_api_lambda.py`
**Lines 2841-2872**: Enhanced campaign creation
```python
# Get user info from request context
launched_by = body.get('launched_by', 'Web User')
if 'requestContext' in event:
    identity = event['requestContext'].get('identity', {})
    source_ip = identity.get('sourceIp', 'Unknown')
    launched_by = f"{launched_by} (IP: {source_ip})"

# Add to campaign_item:
campaign_item['launched_by'] = launched_by
campaign_item['sent_at'] = None  # Set when first email sent
campaign_item['target_contacts'] = target_contact_emails  # Full email list
```

#### `email_worker_lambda.py`
**Lines 119-134**: Enhanced campaign status updates
```python
# Update sent_count and set sent_at timestamp
campaigns_table.update_item(
    Key={'campaign_id': campaign_id},
    UpdateExpression="SET sent_count = sent_count + :inc, sent_at = if_not_exists(sent_at, :timestamp), #status = :status",
    ExpressionAttributeNames={'#status': 'status'},
    ExpressionAttributeValues={
        ':inc': 1,
        ':timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        ':status': 'sending'
    }
)
```

## 📋 Data Flow

### Campaign Creation (Web UI → Lambda)
```
1. User fills campaign form in Web UI
   ├─ Campaign name
   ├─ Subject, body, attachments
   └─ Target filters (group, entity type, etc.)

2. User clicks "🚀 Send Campaign"

3. bulk_email_api_lambda.py processes:
   ├─ Generates campaign_id
   ├─ Captures launched_by (IP address)
   ├─ Records created_at timestamp
   ├─ Queries DynamoDB for target contacts
   ├─ Stores complete target_contacts list
   ├─ Saves to EmailCampaigns table
   └─ Queues messages to SQS

4. Campaign record saved:
   ├─ status: "queued"
   ├─ sent_at: null (not sent yet)
   ├─ sent_count: 0
   └─ target_contacts: [all emails]
```

### Email Sending (SQS → Worker Lambda)
```
1. email_worker_lambda.py processes queue

2. For each message:
   ├─ Retrieve campaign from DynamoDB
   ├─ Retrieve contact details
   ├─ Send email via SES
   └─ Update campaign stats

3. On successful send:
   ├─ Increment sent_count
   ├─ Set sent_at (if first email)
   ├─ Update status to "sending"
   └─ Log success

4. On failed send:
   ├─ Increment failed_count
   └─ Log error

5. Campaign record updated in real-time
```

### Campaign Viewing (Tools → DynamoDB)
```
1. User launches tracking tool
   └─ campaign_tracking_gui.py or campaign_tracking_report.py

2. Tool queries EmailCampaigns table
   └─ Scans all records with pagination

3. Display campaign data:
   ├─ List view: summary of all campaigns
   ├─ Detail view: complete campaign info
   └─ Recipients: all target email addresses

4. Export options:
   ├─ Single campaign → CSV with recipients
   └─ All campaigns → CSV summary table
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Update Lambda Functions

**Update Main API Lambda:**
```bash
# The changes are in bulk_email_api_lambda.py
python update_lambda.py
```

**Update Email Worker Lambda:**
```bash
# The changes are in email_worker_lambda.py
python update_email_worker.py
```

### 2. Verify DynamoDB Schema

The EmailCampaigns table will automatically accommodate new fields. No schema migration needed.

**Optional: Add indexes for better querying**
```bash
aws dynamodb update-table \
  --table-name EmailCampaigns \
  --attribute-definitions AttributeName=launched_by,AttributeType=S AttributeName=created_at,AttributeType=S \
  --global-secondary-index-updates \
    "[{\"Create\":{\"IndexName\":\"launched_by-created_at-index\",\"KeySchema\":[{\"AttributeName\":\"launched_by\",\"KeyType\":\"HASH\"},{\"AttributeName\":\"created_at\",\"KeyType\":\"RANGE\"}],\"Projection\":{\"ProjectionType\":\"ALL\"},\"ProvisionedThroughput\":{\"ReadCapacityUnits\":5,\"WriteCapacityUnits\":5}}}]" \
  --region us-gov-west-1
```

### 3. Test Campaign Tracking

**Test Flow:**
```bash
# 1. Send test campaign from Web UI
https://your-api-gateway-url/prod/
# Fill out campaign form and send

# 2. View in tracking GUI
python campaign_tracking_gui.py
# Campaign should appear with "queued" status

# 3. Wait for emails to process
# Check status changes to "sending" then "completed"

# 4. Verify sent_at timestamp is set
# Check sent_count matches total_contacts

# 5. Export recipient list
# Click "Export Campaign to CSV"
```

### 4. Install GUI Tools (Optional)

No installation needed - tools use standard Python libraries:
- tkinter (included with Python)
- boto3 (already installed)

**For Windows users:**
Create desktop shortcuts to:
- `launch_campaign_tracking.bat`
- `launch_db_manager.bat`
- `launch_test_generator.bat`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Campaign Not Showing in GUI

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify table exists
aws dynamodb describe-table --table-name EmailCampaigns --region us-gov-west-1

# Check if records exist
aws dynamodb scan --table-name EmailCampaigns --limit 5 --region us-gov-west-1

# Verify correct region in GUI
```

### sent_at is Null

**This is normal if:**
- Status is "queued" (emails not sent yet)
- SQS queue is backlogged
- Email worker Lambda not running

**Check:**
```bash
# Check SQS queue depth
aws sqs get-queue-attributes --queue-url YOUR_QUEUE_URL --attribute-names ApproximateNumberOfMessages

# Check Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/email-worker --follow --region us-gov-west-1
```

### Missing target_contacts

**This should not happen for new campaigns**

If it does:
1. Verify Lambda was deployed with updated code
2. Check CloudWatch logs for errors during campaign creation
3. Manually add using DynamoDB Manager (edit campaign JSON)
