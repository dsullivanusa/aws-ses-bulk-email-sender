# CC Separate Email Fix - Summary

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Each person in the CC line was receiving a separate email with only their email address in the CC line.

**Root Cause**: The email worker was processing CC recipients with `role='cc'` as individual email sends, giving each CC recipient their own separate email.

## 🔧 **FIX APPLIED**

### **Location**: `email_worker_lambda.py` - Role-based processing section

### **Before (Problematic Behavior)**:
```python
if role == "cc":
    # CC recipient gets separate email with only their address in CC
    cc_list = [contact_email]  # Only this CC recipient
    contact_email_for_sending = from_email  # Sender as To address
    # Email sent to CC recipient individually
```

### **After (Fixed Behavior)**:
```python
if role == "cc":
    logger.info(f"❌ SKIPPING CC recipient: {contact_email} - CC recipients should not get separate emails!")
    logger.info(f"CC recipients should only appear in CC field of regular contact emails")
    # CC recipients should NOT get separate emails
    results['successful'] += 1  # Count as successful (no email needed)
    continue  # Skip to next message
```

### **Same Fix Applied to BCC Recipients**:
```python
elif role == "bcc":
    logger.info(f"❌ SKIPPING BCC recipient: {contact_email} - BCC recipients should not get separate emails!")
    logger.info(f"BCC recipients should only appear in BCC field of regular contact emails")
    # BCC recipients should NOT get separate emails
    results['successful'] += 1  # Count as successful (no email needed)
    continue  # Skip to next message
```

## 📊 **BEHAVIOR COMPARISON**

### **Before Fix:**
- **5 emails sent** for campaign with 2 contacts + 2 CC + 1 BCC
- ❌ CC recipients got separate emails
- ❌ Each CC recipient only saw their own address in CC field
- ❌ BCC recipients got separate emails

### **After Fix:**
- **2 emails sent** for campaign with 2 contacts + 2 CC + 1 BCC
- ✅ CC recipients get NO separate emails
- ✅ Regular contacts see ALL CC recipients in CC field
- ✅ BCC recipients get NO separate emails

## 📬 **Expected Email Delivery (After Fix)**

### **Campaign Setup:**
- Regular contacts: `user1@example.com`, `user2@example.com`
- CC recipients: `cc1@example.com`, `cc2@example.com`
- BCC recipients: `bcc@example.com`

### **Emails Sent:**

**Email 1 - To user1@example.com:**
```
To: user1@example.com
CC: cc1@example.com, cc2@example.com
BCC: bcc@example.com (hidden)
```

**Email 2 - To user2@example.com:**
```
To: user2@example.com
CC: cc1@example.com, cc2@example.com
BCC: bcc@example.com (hidden)
```

### **No Separate Emails To:**
- ❌ cc1@example.com (appears in CC field only)
- ❌ cc2@example.com (appears in CC field only)
- ❌ bcc@example.com (appears in BCC field only)

## 🔍 **What Recipients See**

### **Regular Contacts (user1, user2):**
- ✅ Receive email addressed to them
- ✅ See all CC recipients in CC field
- ✅ Don't see BCC recipients (hidden)

### **CC Recipients (cc1, cc2):**
- ✅ Receive NO separate emails
- ✅ Only appear in CC field of regular emails
- ✅ Proper CC behavior

### **BCC Recipients (bcc):**
- ✅ Receive NO separate emails
- ✅ Only appear in BCC field of regular emails (hidden)
- ✅ Proper BCC behavior

## 📋 **CloudWatch Logs to Expect**

```
[Message 1] Regular contact message - Including 2 CC addresses and 1 BCC addresses
[Message 2] Regular contact message - Including 2 CC addresses and 1 BCC addresses
[Message 3] ❌ SKIPPING CC recipient: cc1@example.com - CC recipients should not get separate emails!
[Message 4] ❌ SKIPPING CC recipient: cc2@example.com - CC recipients should not get separate emails!
[Message 5] ❌ SKIPPING BCC recipient: bcc@example.com - BCC recipients should not get separate emails!
```
