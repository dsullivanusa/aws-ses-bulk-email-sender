# Image Resize Fix - Quick Summary

## 🐛 Problem
Images pasted into the Quill editor don't appear in sent emails when resize handles are activated, and image size/position doesn't match what's shown in the editor.

## ✅ Solution
Added code to **LOCK image size and position** at the moment the Send Campaign button is clicked. The system captures the exact rendered appearance from the live editor and applies those styles to the email HTML, ensuring perfect WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) accuracy.

## 📁 Files Changed

### Modified
- **`bulk_email_api_lambda.py`** (lines 3939-4116)
  - **Step 1:** Captures computed styles from live Quill editor (exact rendered appearance)
  - **Step 2:** Applies locked styles to all images in HTML
  - **Step 3:** Unwraps images from resize containers
  - **Step 4:** Preserves paragraph-level alignment (center, right, left)
  - Preserves: width, height, margins, float, vertical-align, display, max-width, max-height
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging

### New Documentation
- **`QUILL_IMAGE_RESIZE_FIX.md`** - Technical explanation of the fix
- **`TEST_IMAGE_RESIZE_FIX.md`** - Test scenarios and verification steps
- **`IMAGE_RESIZE_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** - This quick reference

## 🚀 Deployment

To apply the fix:

```bash
python deploy_bulk_email_api.py
```

Or manually update the `BulkEmailAPI` Lambda function in AWS Console.

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Paste an image into the email editor
2. Click the image to show resize handles
3. Drag a corner to resize the image
4. Send a test campaign to yourself
5. **Verify:** Image appears in received email with correct size

## 📊 Console Output

Look for these messages when clicking Send Campaign:

```
🔒 Locked image 1 size/position: {width: "400px", height: "300px", display: "inline", float: "none"}
  ✅ Applied locked styles to image 1
✂️ Unwrapped 1 image(s) from resize containers
  📍 Preserved alignment: center for image
🔒 Locked 1 image(s) to exact editor size/position
  📍 Preserved container alignment: center for image
🖼️ Found 1 embedded image(s) in email body
✅ Uploaded embedded image: attachments/InlineImage1_....png
```

## 🔍 How It Works

```
Before Fix:
Paste image → Resize → Wrapped in <span> → Processing fails → ❌ No image in email

After Fix (v2.0):
Paste image → Resize to desired size → Click Send Campaign → 
  → Capture computed styles from live editor (LOCK size/position) →
  → Unwrap from <span> container →
  → Apply locked styles to <img> tag →
  → Preserve alignment →
  → Upload to S3 →
  → ✅ Email matches editor exactly!
```

## ⚙️ Technical Details

**What the fix does:**
1. **Captures computed styles** from the live Quill editor using `window.getComputedStyle()`
   - Gets the EXACT rendered size and position as displayed to the user
2. **Stores locked styles** in a Map for each image (keyed by src)
3. **Applies locked styles** to images in the processed HTML
   - Ensures email HTML has exact dimensions shown in editor
4. **Unwraps images** from resize containers (`<span>` wrappers)
5. **Preserves alignment** from parent paragraphs/divs (text-align)
6. **Uploads to S3** with all styling intact
7. **Result:** Email matches editor appearance exactly

**Why it's needed:**
- Quill Image Resize Module wraps images in `<span>` containers
- Wrapper contains sizing, but is removed during processing
- Users expect email to look exactly like the editor preview (WYSIWYG)
- Must capture styles AT SEND TIME (not earlier) to get user's final intent
- Email clients need inline styles on `<img>` tags, not wrapper elements

## 📋 Checklist

- [x] Code updated with size/position locking logic
- [x] Computed styles captured from live editor
- [x] Image unwrapping logic implemented
- [x] Alignment preservation added
- [ ] Lambda function deployed to AWS
- [ ] Tested with single resized image
- [ ] Tested with multiple resized images
- [ ] Tested with centered images
- [ ] Tested with left/right aligned images
- [ ] Verified images appear in received emails with exact size
- [ ] Confirmed position/alignment matches editor

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Images still don't appear
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Lambda was deployed with new code
- Check S3 upload permissions

### Wrong image sizes or positions
- Console output should show "Locked image X size/position" messages
- Console should show "Applied locked styles to image X"
- The fix captures exact rendered size AT SEND TIME
- If sizes are wrong, check that images are visible in editor when you click Send
- Try refreshing the page and resizing again
- Check CloudWatch logs for any JavaScript errors during style capture

### Console shows errors
- Review error message in console
- Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda errors
- Verify S3 bucket and attachment endpoint configuration
