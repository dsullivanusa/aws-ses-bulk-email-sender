# 🧹 Campaign Schema Cleanup Guide

## Overview
Remove unnecessary attributes from EmailCampaigns table to simplify the schema and reduce storage.

---

## 📋 Attributes Being Removed

The following attributes will be removed from all campaign records:

| Attribute | Reason for Removal |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `aws_region` | Redundant - already in Lambda config |
| `aws_secret_name` | Security risk - shouldn't be in campaign data |
| `email_service` | Redundant - can be inferred from config |
| `filter_description` | Redundant - can be generated from filter_values |
| `filter_type` | Redundant - can be inferred from filter_values |
| `smtp_port` | Redundant - already in email config |
| `smtp_server` | Redundant - already in email config |

---

## ✅ Attributes Being Kept

These essential attributes remain:

### Core Campaign Data:
- ✅ `campaign_id` - Unique identifier
- ✅ `campaign_name` - User-defined name
- ✅ `subject` - Email subject line
- ✅ `body` - Email HTML content
- ✅ `from_email` - Sender email address

### Tracking & Status:
- ✅ `status` - Current status (queued/sending/completed)
- ✅ `launched_by` - User who launched campaign
- ✅ `created_at` - When campaign was created
- ✅ `sent_at` - When emails were sent

### Statistics:
- ✅ `total_contacts` - Total recipients
- ✅ `sent_count` - Successfully sent
- ✅ `failed_count` - Failed sends
- ✅ `queued_count` - Queued messages

### Recipients & Attachments:
- ✅ `target_contacts` - List of recipient email addresses
- ✅ `filter_values` - Filter criteria used
- ✅ `attachments` - Attached files metadata

---

## 🚀 Cleanup Process

### Step 1: Clean Existing Records

```bash
python cleanup_campaign_columns.py
```

**What it does:**
1. Scans all campaigns in EmailCampaigns table
2. Shows how many campaigns have the unwanted attributes
3. Asks for confirmation
4. Removes the attributes from each campaign record
5. Provides progress updates every 10 campaigns

**Output:**
```
🧹 CLEANUP EMAILCAMPAIGNS TABLE ATTRIBUTES
================================================================================

Table: EmailCampaigns
Region: us-gov-west-1

Attributes to remove:
  ✗ aws_region
  ✗ aws_secret_name
  ✗ email_service
  ✗ filter_description
  ✗ filter_type
  ✗ smtp_port
  ✗ smtp_server

Step 1: Scanning table for all campaigns...
✅ Found 25 campaign records
✅ Found 25 campaigns with attributes to remove

Sample campaign to be updated:
  Campaign ID: campaign_1728057600
  Attributes to remove: aws_region, email_service, smtp_server, smtp_port

⚠️  Update 25 campaigns? (yes/no): yes

Step 2: Removing attributes from 25 campaigns...
  Progress: 10/25 (40.0%)
  Progress: 20/25 (80.0%)
  Progress: 25/25 (100.0%)

================================================================================
✅ CLEANUP COMPLETE
================================================================================
Campaigns Updated: 25
Errors: 0

Removed attributes:
  ✗ aws_region
  ✗ aws_secret_name
  ✗ email_service
  ✗ filter_description
  ✗ filter_type
  ✗ smtp_port
  ✗ smtp_server
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Lambda

```bash
python update_lambda.py
```

This ensures new campaigns won't include the removed attributes.

### Step 3: Verify Cleanup

```bash
# Use DynamoDB Manager to verify
python dynamodb_manager_gui.py

# Or check with AWS CLI
aws dynamodb scan --table-name EmailCampaigns --region us-gov-west-1 --limit 1
```

## 📊 Before & After Comparison

### Before Cleanup (Old Schema):
```json
{
  "campaign_id": "campaign_1728057600",
  "campaign_name": "Security Update",
  "subject": "Alert",
  "body": "<html>...</html>",
  "from_email": "security@agency.gov",
  "aws_region": "us-gov-west-1",          // ✗ REMOVED
  "aws_secret_name": "email-creds",       // ✗ REMOVED
  "email_service": "ses",                 // ✗ REMOVED
  "smtp_server": "smtp.example.com",      // ✗ REMOVED
  "smtp_port": 587,                       // ✗ REMOVED
  "filter_type": "group",                 // ✗ REMOVED
  "filter_description": "IT Staff",       // ✗ REMOVED
  "status": "completed",
  "launched_by": "John Smith",
  "created_at": "2025-10-04T10:00:00",
  "sent_at": "2025-10-04T10:05:00",
  "total_contacts": 150,
  "sent_count": 150,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "target_contacts": ["user1@example.com", ...],
  "filter_values": ["IT Staff", "Security Team"],
  "attachments": []
}
```

### After Cleanup (New Schema):
```json
{
  "campaign_id": "campaign_1728057600",
  "campaign_name": "Security Update",
  "subject": "Alert",
  "body": "<html>...</html>",
  "from_email": "security@agency.gov",
  "status": "completed",
  "launched_by": "John Smith",
  "created_at": "2025-10-04T10:00:00",
  "sent_at": "2025-10-04T10:05:00",
  "total_contacts": 150,
  "sent_count": 150,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "queued_count": 150,
  "target_contacts": ["user1@example.com", ...],
  "filter_values": ["IT Staff", "Security Team"],
  "attachments": []
}
```

**Result:** Cleaner, more focused schema with only essential data!

---

## 💡 Benefits

### Storage:
- ✅ Reduced item size (~30% smaller)
- ✅ Faster scans and queries
- ✅ Lower DynamoDB costs

### Security:
- ✅ No sensitive config data in campaigns
- ✅ No SMTP credentials or secrets
- ✅ Better separation of concerns

### Maintenance:
- ✅ Simpler schema
- ✅ Easier to understand
- ✅ Less redundant data

---

## 🔄 Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to restore the old schema:

**Not recommended** - but if absolutely necessary:
1. Config data is still in EmailConfig table
2. You can manually add fields back using DynamoDB Manager
3. Update Lambda code to re-add fields

---

## 🛡️ Safety Notes

### What's NOT Affected:
- ✅ Campaign tracking still works perfectly
- ✅ Email sending not affected (config is in EmailConfig table)
- ✅ Recipient lists preserved (target_contacts)
- ✅ Attachments preserved
- ✅ Filter values preserved
- ✅ All statistics preserved

### What's Removed:
- ❌ Redundant config fields
- ❌ SMTP settings (use EmailConfig instead)
- ❌ Filter description (can be regenerated from filter_values)

---

## 📝 Testing Checklist

After cleanup:

- [ ] Run cleanup script successfully
- [ ] Deploy updated Lambda
- [ ] Send test campaign
- [ ] Verify campaign appears in tracking
- [ ] Verify no errors in CloudWatch logs
- [ ] Export campaign to CSV (should work)
- [ ] Check campaign in DynamoDB Manager
- [ ] Verify email sending still works

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Script shows 0 campaigns to update

**Cause:** Attributes already removed or no campaigns exist

**Solution:** This is fine - nothing to clean up

### Issue: Errors during update

**Cause:** Permission issues or table locked

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check IAM permissions
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify table is accessible
aws dynamodb scan --table-name EmailCampaigns --limit 1 --region us-gov-west-1
```

### Issue: Campaign sending fails after cleanup

**Cause:** Lambda might be looking for removed fields

**Solution:**
- Deploy updated Lambda: `python update_lambda.py`
- Check CloudWatch logs for specific errors
