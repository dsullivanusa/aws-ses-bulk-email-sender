# Fix for Campaign History 403 Error

## Problem
The Campaign History tab shows a 403 error because the `/campaigns` endpoint (and several others) exist in your Lambda function but are **NOT configured in your API Gateway**.

## Root Cause
Your `api_gateway_config.json` only has these endpoints:
- `/contacts` (GET, POST, OPTIONS)
- `/campaign` (POST, OPTIONS)

But your Lambda function has many more endpoints that are missing from API Gateway:
- ‚ùå `/campaigns` (GET) - **This is causing the 403 error**
- ‚ùå `/config` (GET, POST)
- ‚ùå `/contacts/distinct` (GET)
- ‚ùå `/contacts/filter` (POST)
- ‚ùå `/contacts/batch` (POST)
- ‚ùå `/contacts/search` (POST)
- ‚ùå `/groups` (GET)
- ‚ùå `/upload-attachment` (POST)
- ‚ùå `/preview` (POST, GET)
- ‚ùå `/campaign/{campaign_id}` (GET)

## Solution
Run the `add_missing_api_endpoints.py` script to add all missing endpoints to your existing API Gateway.

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install boto3
```

Make sure you have AWS credentials configured for the `us-gov-west-1` region.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Run the Script
```bash
python add_missing_api_endpoints.py
```

### Step 2: What the Script Does
1. ‚úÖ Finds your existing API Gateway (bulk-email-api)
2. ‚úÖ Gets your Lambda function ARN
3. ‚úÖ Checks which resources already exist
4. ‚úÖ Creates missing resources:
   - `/campaigns` ‚Üê **This fixes the 403 error**
   - `/config`
   - `/contacts/distinct`
   - `/contacts/filter`
   - `/contacts/batch`
   - `/contacts/search`
   - `/groups`
   - `/upload-attachment`
   - `/preview`
5. ‚úÖ Adds HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to each resource
6. ‚úÖ Adds CORS (OPTIONS) support to all endpoints
7. ‚úÖ Grants API Gateway permission to invoke Lambda
8. ‚úÖ Deploys changes to the `prod` stage

### Step 3: Verify
After running the script, you'll see output like:
```
‚úÖ API Gateway updated successfully!
üéâ Your campaign history tab should now work!
   Try accessing: https://[api-id].execute-api.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/campaigns
```

### Step 4: Test Campaign History
1. Open your bulk email UI
2. Go to the **History** tab
3. The campaign history should now load successfully! üéâ

## Expected Output

‚úÖ API Gateway updated successfully!

üéâ Your campaign history tab should now work!
```

## Alternative: Manual Fix (If Script Fails)

If the script doesn't work, you can manually add the `/campaigns` endpoint:

1. Go to AWS Console ‚Üí API Gateway
2. Find "bulk-email-api"
3. Click "Resources"
4. Click "Actions" ‚Üí "Create Resource"
5. Set Resource Path: `campaigns`
6. Click "Create Resource"
7. Select the new `/campaigns` resource
8. Click "Actions" ‚Üí "Create Method"
9. Select "GET" from dropdown
10. Configure:
    - Integration type: Lambda Function
    - Lambda Region: us-gov-west-1
    - Lambda Function: bulk-email-api-function
    - Use Lambda Proxy integration: ‚úÖ Checked
11. Click "Save"
12. Click "Actions" ‚Üí "Enable CORS"
13. Click "Actions" ‚Üí "Deploy API"
14. Select Stage: prod
15. Click "Deploy"

## Why This Happened

The API Gateway configuration was incomplete. When you access the Campaign History tab, JavaScript tries to fetch from `/campaigns`, but since that route doesn't exist in API Gateway, it returns a 403 Forbidden error (API Gateway's way of saying "this route doesn't exist").

The Lambda function HAS the code to handle `/campaigns` requests, but API Gateway never forwards those requests to Lambda because the route isn't configured.

## Files Modified
- ‚úÖ Created: `add_missing_api_endpoints.py` - Script to add missing endpoints
- ‚úÖ Created: `FIX_CAMPAIGN_HISTORY_403.md` - This documentation

## No New API Gateway Needed! ‚úÖ
You do **NOT** need to create a new API Gateway. The script updates your existing one.
