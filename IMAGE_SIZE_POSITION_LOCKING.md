# Image Size and Position Locking - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview

**What This Does:**
When you click "Send Campaign", the system now captures the EXACT size and position of every image as it appears in the Quill editor and locks those attributes into the email HTML. This ensures perfect WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) accuracy - the received email looks exactly like your editor preview.

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Process

```
User pastes image into editor
   ↓
User resizes/positions image to desired appearance
   ↓
User clicks "Send Campaign" button ← LOCKING HAPPENS HERE
   ↓
System captures computed styles from live editor:
   • Width: 400px (exact rendered width)
   • Height: 300px (exact rendered height)
   • Display: block
   • Margins: 10px 0px
   • Float: none
   • Vertical-align: baseline
   • Text-align: center (from parent)
   ↓
System applies locked styles to image in HTML
   ↓
System unwraps image from resize containers
   ↓
System preserves alignment from paragraphs
   ↓
Image uploaded to S3 with all styling
   ↓
Email sent with exact size/position
   ↓
✅ Recipient sees image EXACTLY as it appeared in editor
```

### Technical Implementation

**Step 1: Capture Live Editor Styles**
```javascript
const editorImages = quillEditor.root.querySelectorAll('img');
editorImages.forEach(img => {
    const computedStyle = window.getComputedStyle(img);
    // Captures ACTUAL rendered appearance, not just inline styles
});
```

**Step 2: Lock Styles**
```javascript
// Store all size/position attributes
const lockedStyles = {
    width: "400px",        // Exact pixel width
    height: "300px",       // Exact pixel height
    display: "block",
    marginTop: "10px",
    marginBottom: "10px",
    // ... all positioning attributes
};
```

**Step 3: Apply to HTML**
```javascript
// Apply locked styles to image tag
img.setAttribute('style', 
    'width: 400px; height: 300px; display: block; margin-top: 10px; ...'
);
```

**Step 4: Clean Up**
```javascript
// Remove resize wrapper containers
// Preserve text-align from paragraphs
// Upload to S3
// Send with perfect styling
```
